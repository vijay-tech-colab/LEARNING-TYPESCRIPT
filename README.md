# Learning TypeScript

Welcome to my TypeScript learning journey! This repository documents my progress as I learn TypeScript, a powerful typed superset of JavaScript that adds static typing, enhanced error-checking, and improved code readability.

## Why TypeScript?

TypeScript enables developers to write safer, more maintainable JavaScript code by providing:
- Static typing for early error detection.
- Enhanced IDE support with code autocompletion and type hints.
- Seamless integration with modern JavaScript (ES6+).

## Learning Goals

- Understand TypeScript basics: types, interfaces, classes, and modules.
- Learn how TypeScript integrates with JavaScript.
- Apply TypeScript in real-world projects.

## Topics Covered

1. **Basic Types** - Primitive types, arrays, tuples, and enums.
2. **Functions** - Function types, parameter annotations, and default values.
3. **Interfaces and Classes** - Object-oriented programming in TypeScript.
4. **Generics** - Writing reusable and flexible components.
5. **Modules** - Managing code structure and reusability.
6. **Advanced Types** - Unions, intersections, type assertions, and type guards.

## Projects

### Project 1: [Basic Application]
A simple application to solidify TypeScript fundamentals.

### Project 2: [Advanced Application]
An intermediate project implementing TypeScript with other libraries or frameworks like React, Express, etc.

## How to Run the Code

1. **Install TypeScript**:
   ```bash
   npm install -g typescript
   ```

2. **Compile** `.ts` **files**:
   ```bash
   tsc filename.ts
   ```

3. **Run JavaScript output**:
   ```bash
   node filename.js
   ```
